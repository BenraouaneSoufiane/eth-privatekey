# eth-privatekey
Perhaps we hear such amount (eg $500M, $20M, $1M) were stolen, I believe the hackers use the elliptic curve equations with combination with other methods to get it, I tried that method (to get the private key from raw transaction), require combination with other one, anyway I recommend to use multisig wallet even your wallet don't hold big amount
